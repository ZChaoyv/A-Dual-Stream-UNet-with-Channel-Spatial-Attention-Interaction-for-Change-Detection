Englishï¼šA Dual Stream UNet with Channel Spatial Attention Interaction for Change Detection
This repository contains the official implementation of the paper "A Dual Stream UNet with Channel Spatial Attention Interaction for Change Detection". The proposed method enhances change detection performance by leveraging a dual-stream UNet architecture combined with interactive channel-spatial attention mechanisms, effectively capturing both global context and local detail changes between bi-temporal images.
Key Features
Implementation of the dual-stream UNet backbone for parallel feature extraction from bi-temporal data
Channel-spatial attention interaction modules to emphasize discriminative change-related features
End-to-end training pipeline with support for common change detection datasets (e.g., LEVIR-CD, WHU-CD)
Preprocessing scripts and evaluation metrics (mIoU, F1-score, etc.) for quantitative analysis
Usage
Refer to the README.md for environment setup, dataset preparation, training, and inference instructions.
